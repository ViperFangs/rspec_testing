# ruby_testing

This assignment is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-introduction-to-rspec)

## Expectations

Use RSpec to write tests for calculator.rb

## Final Thoughts

I was introduced to Test Driven Development (TDD) using rspec in this assignment. I wrote various tests for the Calculator class and tested them out by following the 'red-green-refactor' cycle 

I feel confident now in writing my own tests and writing code the TDD way!
